# 201lab02-about-me

### Version 1
<p> In version 1 I used prompt to add in 5 questions, and respond to the user with an alert in a yes or no guessing style game. console.log allowed me to see if things were working without going through all the prompts. I ended the game with an alert using the userName I gathered in the first prompt. </p>

<p> Via html I added in work, education, and goals in a list format. Then I styled these elements using CSS. A reset style sheet is included in this build to remove any default styling. </p>

### Version 2
<p> In this deploy a top ten was added, necessitating an update to the other ordered lists in this page. </p>
<p> I also added in a numeric guessing game, with 4 chances to get a correct guess. </p>
<p> I also added in a word guess game, with 6 guesses. </p>
<p> Finally you can get a score for participating. </p>
